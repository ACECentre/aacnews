Please read the Privacy Policy to understand how your personal information will be treated. This policy may change from time to time so please check it periodically. It was last updated on 18 January 2015.

<h4>2. Personal Information</h4>

2.1 The details which you provide about yourself and any information which identifies you such as your name, address, email address ("Personal Information") will only be retained by us if you provide this information when subscribing to our email lists. Personal Information will be held on our system and used for operational purposes (i.e. sending out the monthly newsletter). We may ask you if you wish to know about other ACE Centre related information. If you do, we will email you occasionally about ACE Centre specific news and events. Each email we send you will offer you the opportunity to amend your preferences.<br /> Note that in order to process emails we use third party services - notably <a href="http://mailchimp.com">MailChimp</a>. 
<br /><br />
2.2 If you would like to revise the information you have provided to us at any time, or if you feel that the information we currently have on record is incorrect, you may update the information online (follow the link at the bottom of a recent email from us) or by emailing enquiries@acecentre.org.uk
<br /><br />
2.3 From time to time, we may ask you for further information in order to update our records or for another particular purpose. We will always tell you how we will use any further information received from you. From time to time we will need to send you our website and service announcement updates.
<br /><br />
2.4 You have the right to obtain from us an electronic or paper copy of all Personal Information concerning yourself by emailing enquiries@acecentre.org.uk or writing to Stephen Carroll at ACE Centre, Hollinwood Business Park, Albert Street, Oldham OL8 3QL.

<h4>3. Log files</h4>
3.1 Every time someone visits our website a log file is generated on our computer.
<br /><br />
3.2 The log file records the time and date of your visit, the files that were requested, your IP (Internet Protocol) address, the referrer URL (if provided) and the browser version. We collect this information to help us diagnose problems and administer our systems, and to audit the geographical make-up of users and how they have arrived at our site (i.e. from what other sites have visitors arrived - this information being obtained from the referrer URL).
<br /><br />
3.3 We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that you remain anonymous even though we include your IP address in our aggregate information. However, we can and will attempt to use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our terms and conditions, or to protect our services and other users.

<h4>4. Cookie Policy</h4>
